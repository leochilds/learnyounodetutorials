# My First Async I/O! draft

A walkthrough for the fourth exercise My First Async I/O from the learnyounode program by Founders and Coders team Digital Alchemy. 

# Task
Write a program that uses a single **asynchronous** filesystem operation to read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console (stdout), similar to running `cat file | wc -l`.

The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first command-line argument.

# New Terms
    

# Script
